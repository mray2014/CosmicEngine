# Cosmic Engine

## Overview
After two gruelling attempts with making and researching game engine development. This time I looked forward to understanding how to structure 
a game engines systems properly. In the previous engines I had run into alot of design mistakes with circular dependancies and hacky ways to
get around them. With this engine I said "No more..." Thus started my third engine where I mainly focused on engine structure and making a full
demo game inside of it.

## Goals
My goals for this engine were:
- Implementing a clean engine structure


## My Personal Engines:
### [**DayDreamEngine**](https://github.com/mray2014/DayDreamEngine)
- My latest engine I created to learn and study how to make an engine multi-threaded
- Combining all my years of experience with building engines to structure the engines architecure correctly
- Making the engine multiple platform so that adding new platforms like (DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan) to the lower levels run smoothly


### [**GenesisX**](https://github.com/mray2014/GenesisX)
- My second game engine I have created and it is honestly the one engine I most proud of
- After researching for weeks I finally implemented Deferred rendering into the engine, the hard work paid off
- Once I got that feature in I started steam rolling new graphical features in easily like HDR and Bloom because of all the knowledge I gained from Deferred Rendering


### [**Enginerino**](https://github.com/mray2014/Enginerino)
- My first game engine I ever created that I hold near and dear to my heart, even though it's not very good haha
- Implemented instance rendering for primitive models
- Created Tetris inside with my engine that plays smoothly
- This is when I found out engines were awesome and that I was about to down a very very VERY deep rabbit hole
